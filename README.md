# Mercenary

Mercenary is a simple mod that allows you to press a keybind (by default #) whilst near villagers to get a quest for your team

the quest will either be "deliver a package to X" where that location will be a village,
or "you must deal with some rogues at X" where you will have to go to a location (Datapack configurable) that is hostile

both quests require you to place a block at/near the location specified once you have removed all hostile mobs in a
small radius, remaining mobs will be lit up with the glowing effect if they still exist

once you return to a village after completing the quest, you can claim 10 emeralds (I think this is a placeholder)
